# Image-to-Text-Converter

I have written a program to extract text out of a given image to validate if the image contains the data we are looking for. I have used PyTesseract which is a Python wrapper of Tesseract OCR library and Python Imaging Libray (PIL) in image_to_text.py.

To run this program,

`$python3 image_to_text.py test3.png`

and then

`$python3 isvalid.py output.txt`
